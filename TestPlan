Edge Case Scenarios not tested and might differ from OS to OS :
- What happens if the folder is deleted at runtime ?
Expected Result : Throw a warning and recreate the folder and continue
- Inavlid Folder path is choosen or a folder which does not have write access for the user running the program
- Limit on the number of files that will be created if this keeps running
TODO : Add a limiter to the number of files
- Test the above in different OS
