develop a minimal UI application using Qt C++ UI framework that cyclically creates and deletes files in a folder while monitoring the folder contents. The requirements for the application are as follows:

- A thread that cyclically generates files with consecutive numbers in the file name in the directory and writes minimal text content to each newly created file

- Another thread that cyclically deletes the oldest file from the directory based on the consecutive number in the file name

- A state machine that cyclically monitors the directory for the number of files and displays the monitoring status in the UI

- Minimal UI with “green,” “yellow,” and “red” indicators:

- “Green” indicator if more than one file is present in the directory

- Display “red” if there are no more files in the directory

- Display “yellow” if there are more than 20 files in the directory

- Adjustable generation interval & deletion interval without stopping threads

Further Things added:

- A dashboard to see the files
- a button to clear the directory
- a button to start/stop the operations
- a button to choose the folder 


Testing Questions:
a. is there a limit to the files that can be created?
b. Range of time for creation and deletion?
c. Do I allow deletion faster than creation on a empty folder?
d. If I understood the translation correctly, the create and delete should work parallely





Further TODOs for me:
- move the widgets to the mainwindow.ui so that they can be adapted
- understand the difference between qmake and cmake, can a project have both?
- how to deploy the same application across various platforms?
- why was it crashing upon using unique_ptr
- add a button to further stop creation and deletion if needed
- Log the debugging instructions in a file
- change the deletion alogrithm so that it does fifo
-
